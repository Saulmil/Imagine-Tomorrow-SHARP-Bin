# Imagine-Tomorrow-SHARP-Bin
This program operates the SHARP bin. After the user presses "Enter", a picture is taken of the object in the bin and it is sorted as either trash or recycling based on reflection. Requires a Raspberry Pi, Pi Camera, and PWM servo to run. Created by Miles Saul and Aneesh Pappu.
